# Odin HTML Recipes Project
An HTML project repo to complete one of The Odin Project challenge.

## Description

This project is about a website of food recipes.

Here I'll create a 4 webpages, where each one represents a food recipe. In each page will be titles, paragraphs with some sentences in bold and italic, and a list.

Of course the recipes pages will contain images to not be ugly and links to make posible navigation between them.

I'll hope all you'll like my little work. Thanks!
